                An atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element<br> Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. <br> Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across. <br> They are so small that accurately predicting their behavior <br> using classical physics—as if they were tennis balls, for example—is not possible due to quantum effects. <br>
                Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. <br> The nucleus is made of one or more protons and a number of neutrons. <br> Only the most common variety of hydrogen has no neutrons. <br> More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge,<br>  the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. <br> If the number of protons and electrons are equal, then the atom is electrically neutral. <br> If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall <br> negative or positive charge, respectively – such atoms are called ions.<br>
                The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force. <br> The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the nuclear force. This force is usually <br> stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another. <br> Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force. <br> In this case, the nucleus splits and leaves behind different elements. <br> This is a form of nuclear decay. <br>
                The number of protons in the nucleus is the atomic number and it defines to which chemical element the atom belongs. <br> For example, any atom that contains 29 protons is copper. <br> The number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element. <br> Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules or crystals. <br> The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature. <br> Chemistry is the discipline that studies these changes
